Put any notes for us here:
Setup the application to use server side rendering. This allowed me to develop a little quicker. Added Material Kit Pro React Ui Kit. Successfully got all players shown on cards. I'm not a Senior React Developer but I can learn quickly. Overall this was a great challenge.
